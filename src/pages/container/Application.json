    "problem": "Hypertension, often referred to as the 'silent killer', is a global health challenge affecting over 1.4 billion people, with projections reaching 1.6 billion by 2025. It is the most critical modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and all-cause mortality.",
    "impact": "Less than 15% of those affected have their hypertension adequately controlled, leading to severe long-term consequences such as heart disease, stroke, and renal failure. Lifestyle factors like high salt intake and sedentary behavior contribute to the rising prevalence, particularly in developing nations with limited awareness and treatment options.",
    "burden": "The burden extends beyond individual health, straining healthcare systems. Approximately one-third of adults with hypertension remain untreated or inadequately managed, leading to increased healthcare costs and complications.",
    "solution": {
      "technology": "eBP (in-ear blood pressure monitor)",
      "features": [
        "Continuous, accurate, and user-friendly monitoring",
        "Non-invasive and cuffless using advanced photoplethysmography (PPG) technology",
        "Real-time monitoring without discomfort associated with traditional cuff-based methods",
        "Seamless integration into daily routines"
      ],
      "benefits": [
        "Detects fluctuations in blood pressure throughout the day",
        "Identifies masked hypertension and abnormal blood pressure variability",
        "Enhances patient compliance and engagement in health management",
        "Improves blood pressure control by enabling frequent measurements and timely interventions"
      ],
      "impact": "By addressing the limitations of existing monitoring devices, the eBP empowers users to proactively manage their health, reducing the healthcare burden and improving outcomes."
