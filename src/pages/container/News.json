  "title": "VitaWave Secures $150,000 Grant from Colorado OEDIT for Innovative In-Ear Blood Pressure Monitoring Device Development",
  "date": "Boulder, CO, November 22, 2024",
  "p1": "VitaWave is pleased to announce that it has been awarded a grant of $150,000 from the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) to support the development of an innovative in-ear blood pressure monitoring device 1 .",
  "p2": "This project is a collaborative effort with the Intelligent Networked Systems and Cybernetics Laboratory (InsCy Lab) at the University of Colorado Denver, where Nam Bui, the principal investigator and technical advisor to VitaWave, will lead the research and development efforts.",
  "p3": "The grant from OEDIT underscores the state's commitment to fostering groundbreaking innovations in healthcare technology. This funding will enable VitaWave to advance its research into non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, a critical area of need in modern medicine. As hypertension remains a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, the ability to monitor blood pressure accurately and conveniently can significantly enhance patient outcomes and management strategies 2 .",
  "p4": "The proposed in-ear device aims to provide continuous and accurate blood pressure readings, facilitating better self-management for patients and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.",
  "p5": "The significance of this project extends beyond technological advancement; it aligns with current trends in telehealth and remote patient monitoring. Research indicates that self-monitoring of blood pressure, particularly through telehealth models, can lead to improved management of hypertension and better adherence to treatment protocols 3 .",
