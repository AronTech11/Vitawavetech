          <h3>Better than the traditional cuff</h3>
          <p>
            VitaWaveâ€™s eBP device is a cuffless, remote, continuous blood
            pressure monitoring that: Accurately measures BP comfortably with an
            earpiece. The ear is an ideal location for blood pressure monitoring
            with a dense vascular structure and fixed distance from the heart.
            Provides readings without impacting the userâ€™s normal activities.
            Logs data remotely to facilitate efficient BP management and
            treatment. We've conducted extensive proof-of-concept prototype
            demonstrations and evaluations, including a comparative study
            involving 35 subjects. Subjects reported both ease of use and
            comfort with the device. The study results show promising accuracy,
            with mean errors of 1.8 mmHg for systolic and -3.1 mmHg for
            diastolic values, well within FDA-acceptable margins.
